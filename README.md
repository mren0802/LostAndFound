# LostAndFound

## Project Description

This is a lost and found Flask for Babson College. Students can submit a form to report found items and include an item name, item description and an image to upload if they have one. Students can also submit a form to report lost items with the same features as the form to report found items. The data from these two forms are stored in MySQL, which then generates it as a list on the local host website where you can see all the reported items with their category of either lost or found. To make it hassle free for students, there is also a search feature on the local host website for students to lookup an item.
