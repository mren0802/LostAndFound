# Project Description:

## The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.

The main idea of the project is to create a Flask App for a Lost and Found at Babson, where Babson students can report missing items and either input the name and/or product description of what’s “lost” into a web-app. The Babson student with the missing item can then look up their name on the app to see if someone reported something of theirs as missing or look at product descriptions of what is lost to see if that belongs to them. Our minimum viable product is to have a web interface that is accessible to users to see a list of lost items and found items. Users will report the lost items or report items as found through a quick form that will be manually processed by us. Our stretch goal is to 

Stretch Goals:
Create a reward system for people who successfully upload missing items that are connected with people
add filters to search for items based on various criteria, to implement responsive design in our interface for user friendliness across different devices and platforms, and also implement user accounts to allow users to login, track their reported items and edit/delete their entries.
limit people who can upload items and look through items on Babson email accounts

## Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

### Michelle’s Learning Goals: 
Gain a better and more solid understanding of the Flask framework 
Practice collaborative coding with Github pull and merge requests
Gain experience with working on HTML templates 
Build a complete web app using CRUD principles

## Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.
To start off, we are going to explore the basic Flask structures to build the initial demo version of our Lost and Found application. Then we will look into the various Flask extensions out there that are suitable for form handling and database integration when we want to take things to a more complex level. We will also try to implement some front-end tools to implement and use Flask to create a better user interface more efficiently. 

Stretch Goals:
We may integrate Figma to build out a aesthetically pleasing web page faster. 
Use MySQL to create an easy-to-use database that also has no problem with storing items with detailed descriptions of it. 

## Project Schedule: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.

Week 1: Identify and familiarize ourselves with all necessary frameworks (Flask, MYSQL, Figma, etc.) and formulate a plan to build out integration between 
Week 2: Create item upload feature (image, item description, etc.) and look up feature
Week 3: Build out back end of databases and connect with features
Week 4: Build out front end with Figma and connect front and backend. 
Week 5-6: Find a server to host web app and improve UX/UI as needed. If time allows, achieve stretch goals.


## Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.

Our group will divide tasks up to allow each group member to focus on specific aspects of the project that are strengths of the group members and to be able to work on things at different times that are more suited to each group member’s availability. The tasks will be incorporated separately to prevent a group member from waiting on the other group member to get the next steps of the project started or done. It prevents time lags from happening. Although we are choosing to do things separately, a comprehensive pair program will still occur to a certain extent. We will meet up at least once a week to discuss not only the progress of the project, but also to spend some time working on some parts of the project together to ensure that all the separate parts of the project will still come together as a cohesive and coherently wholesome project. This will also ensure effective team collaboration that everyone is not only on the right track, but also doing their due diligence’s worth. 

## Risks and Limitations: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?

We believe that the most significant threat to this project’s success is the deep learning curve as neither of us are well versed in Flask and are worried that we will struggle with making things happen and work the exact way that we want it to due to our lack of knowledge on some features of Flask. Another risk is underestimating the scope of work required for developing each feature in conjunction with developing a intuitive UX/UI.

## Additional Course Content: What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project?

Additional course content that we think will be beneficial to our project is understanding more of how HTML code works and also perhaps SQLAlchemy as that is Flask’s recommended ORM for database integration. We can also benefit from understanding more of the different types and implementations of responsive designs in our coding.
